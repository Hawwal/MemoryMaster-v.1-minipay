**Memory Master** is a fast-paced pattern challenge game that combines cognitive training with competitive gaming. Built as a Mini App with Noah AI on the CELO blockchain, it offers players an engaging way to improve their visual memory while competing on a global leaderboard.

## 🎮 About

Memory Master combines visual memory training with competitive gameplay. Players must observe randomly generated Tetris-like patterns, memorize their positions, and accurately recreate them within strict time limits. As levels progress, patterns become larger and more complex, pushing your memory to its limits.

Built as a Mini App with CELO blockchain integration, Memory Master offers a unique blend of cognitive challenge and Web3 gaming.
